# Bike Sales Analysis in Excel

## Project Overview

In this project, "Bike Sales Analysis in Excel," I delved deep into the world of data to unravel the story behind bicycle sales. My mission was to clean, analyse, and transform this data into a visually compelling narrative. Through careful data cleaning, I ensured the foundation was set for accurate analysis, eliminating any obstacles that could skew the insights.

Leveraging Excel’s robust pivot tables, I dissected the sales data to uncover pivotal trends across different regions and product categories. This analytical journey revealed the number of purchased bikes per age, the number of purchased bikes per commute distance, which regions were soaring in popularity and the average income of those who’ve purchased or not bikes, providing a clear picture of market dynamics.

With Excel's diverse charting capabilities, I brought the data to life through engaging visualizations. Each chart served as a window into the sales performance, showcasing everything from seasonal trends to category dominance.

## Dynamic Dashboard Creation

The next step of this project was the creation of a dynamic dashboard. Equipped with slicers and designed for ease of use, the dashboard offered a real-time, interactive view of the sales landscape. Users could effortlessly navigate through the data, filtering by region, marital statuts or education, making it a powerful tool for strategic decision-making.

## Key Insights

- **Purchased Bikes per Age**: Insight into the age groups most likely to purchase bikes.
- **Purchased Bikes per Commute Distance**: Understanding how commute distance influences bike purchases.
- **Regional Popularity**: Analysis of which regions have the highest bike sales.
- **Average Income Analysis**: Comparison of average incomes between those who have and have not purchased bikes.

## Conclusion

This project not only honed my skills in Excel but also underscored the power of data visualization in uncovering and telling a story hidden within numbers. It's a testament to how data, when cleaned, analyzed, and presented thoughtfully, can provide invaluable insights for any business.
